# 🎯 AlgoVis
## 🌟 Algorithm Visualization Showcase

AlgoVis is an interactive visualization tool designed to demonstrate the execution of various **sorting** and **grid-based** algorithms. It provides an intuitive way to analyze and understand algorithm behavior in real-time through animations and graphical representations.

## 🔍 Algorithm Demonstrations

### 🎨 Flood Fill in a 2D Grid
Flood Fill algorithm demonstrates how an area can be recursively filled starting from a given point, similar to a paint bucket tool in image editors.

### 🗺️ Pathfinding with BFS in a 2D Grid
Breadth-First Search (BFS) finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid, useful for pathfinding in navigation systems and AI applications.

### 📊 Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds a sorted array one element at a time, efficiently handling small datasets and nearly sorted data.

### 🔄 Shell Sort
Shell Sort extends Insertion Sort by comparing distant elements to reduce total comparisons, significantly improving efficiency.

### 🔀 Gnome Sort
Gnome Sort swaps misplaced elements while iterating, behaving similarly to Insertion Sort but without pre-determined gap sequences.
